# dockhand

A simple tool to help configuring Jenkins [Yet Another Docker Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/yet-another-docker-plugin) without using the Jenkins web UI.

If you are using YAD plugin you know that managing Docker Templates can get out of hand - so many settings in the UI, so easy to miss something important.

I created this tool for two reasons:

1. Configuring Docker templates in the UI is time consuming and error-prone.
2. I wanted to be able to automate the creation of new Cloud Templates as part of a automated build-engineering process. My scripts can use this tool to accomplish that.

## It is early

No polish, no glitter. Alright it is downright ugly. 
Works for me at the moment.
